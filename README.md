# Tailwind.css Colors Extracted

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you have ever wondered, it would be nice to include [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)'s colors in your project **without** loading too much code, as I often do, here it goes.

I have extracted a handful of helper CSS classes and decided to share.

Note: master.css file contains all classes in one place.
